## Geographic Hotspot Identification for Migration

## Description
This project will explore how visualization and spatial analytics can reveal geographic “hotspots” of migration risk using open data. The core idea is to combine multiple socioeconomic and environmental indicators — such as poverty, unemployment, education levels, remittances, and climate risk — into a composite migration-risk score for each region. The focous will be Latin America and the Caribbean.
